Hi, I’m @petjahn, a Senior Software Engineer with more than 13 years experience – as a developer, project manager (PM), team leader, and software architect – mainly in the aviation field.

I have hands-on experience in developing and supporting a highly available, scalable, and reliable messaging system of a Big Tech company.

I'm mainly interested in designing large-scale, highly available systems, but basically any kind of challenge a developer can face nowadays excites me.

I was working mainly with Java, but I strongly believe that every problem needs to be solved using the technology that fits best for the problem (and not the programmer).

When not working, I am passionate about traveling (and hiking!) around the globe taking all sorts of photographs on the road.
